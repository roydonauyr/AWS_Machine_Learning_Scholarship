# AWS_Machine_Learning_Scholarship

## Project 1 (Description)
In this project, you'll use the AutoGluon library to train several models for the Bike Sharing Demand competition in Kaggle. You will be using Tabular Prediction to fit data from CSV files provided by the competition. This project will demonstrate your ability to use AutoGluon to train several iterations of models and record your personal optimization of the problem.

Bike-sharing demand is highly relevant to related problems companies encounter, such as Uber, Lyft, and DoorDash. Predicting demand not only helps businesses prepare for spikes in their services but also improves customer experience by limiting delays.

In the end, you will have submitted several entries to the competition and achieved a rank within Kaggle. You will also complete a report of your findings that you can share publicly on Kaggle or your personal page, providing a way to showcase your work.

## Project 2 (Description)
Project 2 is too big to upload as a zip file hence it will be in a separate repository.

As a machine learning engineer, you’ve gained familiarity with deep learning, a powerful tool for a number of tasks – not the least of which is computer vision. As part of a new product, you’ve been asked to prototype a system for optical character recognition (OCR) on handwritten characters. Since the team is still collecting samples of data, you’ve been tasked with providing a proof of concept on the MNIST database of handwritten digits, a task with very similar input and output.

In this project, you will be given a Jupyter Notebook to do all of your coding and written explanations. You will preprocess a dataset for handwritten digit recognition, build a neural network, then train and tune that neural network using your data.

## Project 3 (Description)
This project is by far the most challenging one out of the three as it requires building of a neural network from scratch and hitting an accuracy of above 50%.

In this project, you will apply the skills you have acquired in the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) course to build a landmark classifier.

Photo sharing and photo storage services like to have location data for each photo that is uploaded. With the location data, these services can build advanced features, such as automatic suggestion of relevant tags or automatic photo organization, which help provide a compelling user experience. Although a photo's location can often be obtained by looking at the photo's metadata, many photos uploaded to these services will not have location metadata available. This can happen when, for example, the camera capturing the picture does not have GPS or if a photo's metadata is scrubbed due to privacy concerns.

If no location metadata for an image is available, one way to infer the location is to detect and classify a discernible landmark in the image. Given the large number of landmarks across the world and the immense volume of images that are uploaded to photo sharing services, using human judgment to classify these landmarks would not be feasible.

In this project, you will take the first steps towards addressing this problem by building models to automatically predict the location of the image based on any landmarks depicted in the image. You will go through the machine learning design process end-to-end: performing data preprocessing, designing and training CNNs, comparing the accuracy of different CNNs, and deploying an app based on the best CNN you trained.

## Project 4 (Description)
This final project puts everything together by building an entire machine learning pipeline using lambda and step functions.

**Background**
Image Classifiers are used in the field of computer vision to identify the content of an image and it is used across a broad variety of industries, from advanced technologies like autonomous vehicles and augmented reality, to eCommerce platforms, and even in diagnostic medicine.

You are hired as a Machine Learning Engineer for a scone-delivery-focused logistics company, Scones Unlimited, and you’re working to ship an Image Classification model. The image classification model can help the team in a variety of ways in their operating environment: detecting people and vehicles in video feeds from roadways, better support routing for their engagement on social media, detecting defects in their scones, and many more!

In this project, you'll be building an image classification model that can automatically detect which kind of vehicle delivery drivers have, in order to route them to the correct loading bay and orders. Assigning delivery professionals who have a bicycle to nearby orders and giving motorcyclists orders that are farther can help Scones Unlimited optimize their operations.

As an MLE, your goal is to ship a scalable and safe model. Once your model becomes available to other teams on-demand, it’s important that your model can scale to meet demand, and that safeguards are in place to monitor and control for drift or degraded performance.

In this project, you’ll use AWS Sagemaker to build an image classification model that can tell bicycles apart from motorcycles. You'll deploy your model, use AWS Lambda functions to build supporting services, and AWS Step Functions to compose your model and services into an event-driven application. At the end of this project, you will have created a portfolio-ready demo that showcases your ability to build and compose scalable, ML-enabled, AWS applications.
